# Objective:

The aim of this project is to blink the LED in a more smarter way using Atmega328. The blinking simply means the ON and OFF of the LED, it's more simple as that of switching the power supply ON and OFF.

# Introduction:

Sequential LEDs uses the LED (light-emitting diode) built into Atmega328 to flash on and off. To do that, you need to tell Atmega328 that the LED is an OUTPUT that should be turned on (HIGH) and off (LOW) with a pause between each command.
